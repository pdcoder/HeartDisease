This is a chat application which I developed as to experiment with my knowledge of Websockets. I developed the application with NodeJS. The frontend is developed with plain old HTML. In this app, an user can can enter any enter a chat room, and can chat with members who enter the same chat room. I have used a popular library - Socket.io to utilize its ability to create and bind to web socket events. I have made use of MomentJS to format timestamps that appear along with messages. I have also used MustacheJS to achieve unit testing in development mode. In the future, I am looking forward to integrating a chatbot in the application which will provide effective feedback to the user.
