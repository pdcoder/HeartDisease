# MyHeart
Heart related problems have become a norm in our society these days. Often we are advised to carry out certain tests to evaluate the risk that is associated with our heart. But it is not possible for any average person to
comprehend the results of the tests. So, I have developed this app to tell us the risk level on a scale of 0-4, with the help of Artificial Neural Networks and TensorflowJS running in the backend with NodeJS.
